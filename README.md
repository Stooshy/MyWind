# MyWind
Helps calculating the influence of wind in [Shot Online](http://www.shot-online.com/)
 
MyWind makes a suggestion of how far you should have to play the ball. Parameters are:
 
 * Weather.
 * Wind.
 * Direction of wind.
 * Distance to target (range).

</br>
In the example shown above the user entered 2.4 m/s for speed of wind, tailwind heading northeast, clouds and 225y to play. 
</br>
MyWind suggests:

 * to go for 237y.
 * to compensate 1.7% crosswind from left (for example with i5: ~2 clicks left).

Temperature and slope have to be considered by the user.
